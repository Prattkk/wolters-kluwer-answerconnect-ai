# AI-Enabled Research & Drafting Enhancements for CCH AnswerConnect

## Overview
This repository contains a **student-built AI prototype and conceptual implementation** developed as part of the **MS in Business Analytics (BADM 550 – Business Practicum)** at the **University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign**, in collaboration with **Wolters Kluwer**.

The project explores how **large language models (LLMs)** and workflow automation can transform the **research and drafting experience** for **tax and legal professionals** using **CCH AnswerConnect**, with a strong focus on **trust, transparency, productivity, and governance**.

---

## Problem Context
User research revealed three major gaps in the current research experience:

- **Awareness Gap** – Advanced AI capabilities exist but are not surfaced contextually, leading to underutilization.
- **Trust Gap** – Users hesitate to rely on AI due to limited explainability, source grounding, and citation transparency.
- **Experience Gap** – AI search feels disconnected from natural research and drafting workflows, causing users to revert to manual processes.

As a result, professionals adapt their workflow to the tool rather than the tool adapting to how professionals work.

---

## Solution Summary
The project proposes **two high-impact, enterprise-ready AI solutions** designed to integrate seamlessly into existing workflows while maintaining human oversight and compliance.

---

## 1️⃣ Integrated Research & Drafting AI Workspace
A unified in-platform drafting environment where **research and writing occur together**.

### Key Capabilities
- **Context-aware AI suggestions** for statutes, regulations, and authoritative guidance
- **Automatic, real-time legal citations** (e.g., Bluebook / ALWD formats)
- **Compliance flags & alerts** for unsupported claims or outdated authorities
- **Persistent research memory** that captures searches, annotations, and sources across sessions

This replaces the fragmented “search → copy → paste → validate” workflow with a continuous, in-context research experience.

---

## 2️⃣ Cognitive Workflow Orchestrator (IRP – Intelligent Research Pipeline)
A **no-code orchestration engine** that automates complex, multi-step research and review workflows.

### Key Capabilities
- Drag-and-drop **workflow builder** for research pipelines
- Coordination of **AI agents and human reviewers**
- **Approval routing, audit trails, and governance controls**
- **Analytics dashboards** for visibility into progress, quality, and compliance

The orchestrator functions as an **intelligent project manager**, reducing manual coordination while preserving human judgment at critical checkpoints.

---

## Live Prototype
A functional prototype demonstrating both solutions is available here:

🔗 **https://peaceful-valkyrie-7f0fbb.netlify.app/**

The prototype showcases:
- AI-assisted drafting with real-time authority suggestions
- Citation visualization and risk alerts
- Workflow builder and execution views
- Governance and analytics concepts

---

## Architecture & Implementation
The proposed architecture follows an **enterprise-grade design**, including:
- LLM + Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Secure content APIs and metadata indexing
- Research memory and vector storage
- Workflow orchestration and routing engines
- Audit logging, access controls, and compliance layers

A phased **18–20 month roadmap** outlines prototype development, pilot rollout, and production readiness.

---

## Competitive Differentiation
Competitive analysis against platforms such as **Westlaw, Lexis+ AI, Harvey AI, and Casetext** showed that:
- Existing tools focus on isolated AI tasks
- No competitor offers a **unified research + drafting workspace with persistent memory**
- End-to-end workflow orchestration remains largely manual

These solutions position **CCH AnswerConnect** to deliver a differentiated, trust-first AI research ecosystem.
